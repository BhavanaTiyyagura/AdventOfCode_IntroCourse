Puzzle 1, Day 2 Code Explanation
Bhavana Tiyyagura

Extension of Puzzle 1, here we “need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list”

In the previous part, we already read the file and have the two lists as leftArray and rightArray.

Note: Each integer from the left list is treated separately, even if it appears multiple times. For example, if a number appears more than once in leftArray, we still calculate its similarity score each time it occurs.

Approach to solving the problem:
* We take each element in the leftArray, and loop over the right list to see how many times that element has occurred in the rightArray.
* For each match, we increment a counter variable count.
* After the rightArray has been checked, we calculate the Similarity Score by multiplying the element from the leftArray with the count.
* Store each similarity score in a list or accumulate it directly.

* After every element in leftArray has a similarity score, add them all together to get the final result.
